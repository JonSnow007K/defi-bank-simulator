## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this real money?**
A: The DeFiChain Bank Simulator is a demonstration application. In simulation mode, no real funds are involved. Actual blockchain transactions require real cryptocurrency.

**Q: Do I need MetaMask?**
A: For full functionality, MetaMask is recommended. However, simulation mode works without it.

**Q: Can I use other wallets?**
A: Currently, the app is optimized for MetaMask. Support for other wallets may be added in future updates.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What network should I use?**
A: For local development, use Hardhat network. For testing, use a testnet like Sepolia. Never use mainnet with test applications.

**Q: How are transactions processed?**
A: Transactions are sent to the Ethereum network (or test network). The smart contracts process them on-chain.

**Q: What are gas fees?**
A: Gas fees are network fees for processing transactions. These vary based on network congestion and transaction complexity.

## Conclusion

You're now ready to explore the DeFiChain Bank Simulator! Start with the Dashboard to understand the interface, then explore Transactions for detailed analytics, participate in Governance to influence protocol decisions, and review Security to understand protection measures.

Remember: This is a simulation for educational purposes. Always exercise caution when dealing with real cryptocurrency and blockchain applications.
